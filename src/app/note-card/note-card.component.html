    Let's put the if here, where if the 
    task is done then it is gone 
    note that it makes the button 
    NOT EXIST if the ngIf condition is met

    note that ngIf will always try to correct 
    any JS statement within it to a boolean 
    value, so try to think ahead and make 
    it be a boolean value, otherwise the 
    code will be far harder to read
