<h1> Welcome to {{ data.title }} </h1>

<!-- Now lets link the data object we made -->

<!-- 
  This is not following angular sytax though, 
  angular likes to use [] to designate different 
  items of use

  For example, this "Test" is now an 
  expression, that can be now manipulated rather 
  than hard coded in, but the code won't compile because 
  "Test" is not within the app.component.ts file

  Change it to data.title though, and it will compile

<input class="demo" [value]="data.title">
