<h1> Welcome to {{ data.title }} </h1>

<!-- Now lets link the data object we made -->

<!-- 
  This is not following angular sytax though, 
  angular likes to use [] to designate different 
  items of use

  For example, this "Test" is now an 
  expression, that can be now manipulated rather 
  than hard coded in, but the code won't compile because 
  "Test" is not within the app.component.ts file

  Change it to data.title though, and it will compile

  This is because the view is pulling information from 
  the model, through a clear and concise manner. Remember 
  that all of this is possible because it is linked via
  the app.component

  But what if I want it to be a string? Double wrap the
  text in quotations (double then single to keep it ledgible) 
  then watch it compile and show, but this usually is not used. 

  Why not use it? Simple, there's an easier way to write this, 
  and if you use angular, you use it for the modularity and 
  to reuse code regularly or pass data as it updates
 -->
<input class="demo" [value]="'Test'">

<!-- 
  A core strength of angular is the ability to handle
  in browser events within the app itself. So let's add 
  a link to the project and see how it works.
